# MiniSpool
An [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) design for a mini filament spool holder for a 3D printer.

I bought some 15 foot flexible filament samples from [3DPrintNY.com](http://3dprintny.com/) which are sold as loose filament coils in a bag. I wanted to be able to put them on a spool but didn't find anything that seemed right for my application so I created something inspired by [jimustanguitar](https://www.thingiverse.com/jimustanguitar/about)'s [mini spool](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1411626) for 50g samples.

I created this to be customizable to different sizes and for different hub diameters.

This is also published on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2342235).
